## I made changes to my friend's project [*her site*](https://github.com/opasaskek/fold/tree/master) without her direct involvement because she wanted to do the project herself. However, she didn't object to my corrections.
List of changes:
* Optimisation:
  * compressed images of cities (<b>high optimization</b>)
  * transferred the card information to js format

* Design:
  * added shadows under the text
  * change size & font
  * change design cards
  * added animations
###### I hope that when she reads it, she won't be angry with me.ðŸ˜…
