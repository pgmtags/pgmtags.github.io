## I made changes to my friend's project [*her site*](https://github.com/opasaskek/fold/tree/master) without her direct involvement because she wanted to do the project herself. However, she didn't object to my corrections.
List of changes:
* compressed images of cities (<b>high optimization</b>)
* transferred the card information to js format
* added animations to the appearance of cards and images
* added shadows under some of the text
* added dynamic nav panel
* change font and size
###### I hope that when she reads it, she won't be angry with me.ðŸ˜…
